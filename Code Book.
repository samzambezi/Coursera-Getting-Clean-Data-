This code book contains a description of the variables, the data, and the transformations performed on the Human Activity Recognition 
Using Smartphones data set.

##The Data
The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set was obtained form UCI Machine Learning Repository 
< http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>. 
The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate the "ability to collect, work with and clean a data set".

##Transformations 
Dowloaded the data sets for train and test as well as features and activities data
Using the features data set:
Variable names where transformed to remove the "()" parenthesis
Estimated variable names where updated to capital letters 
The function rbind was used to assign the variable names to the row data for both test and training data
The test and training data sets where mergered to form a new data frame that was named X_data
X_data was further filtered to only include only the mean and std variables
This created a new data set called tidy_data 
X_data was used to create a new summarised data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and subject
The steps where as follows: 
train and test Y data where merged to form a new data set called Activities
Activities data set was merged with the activities labels by activityID to form a new data set
called merge_activities_data
merge_activities_data was further merged with the original data ser X_data
All column names where updated according 
lapply was used to perform the calculation that summaried the data 
the data was written into a file called Summary_Stats_tidy_data

##Variables of the tidy_data set
